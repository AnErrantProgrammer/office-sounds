## Sounds

There are three types of sounds:

* Background - The constant hum of the office
* Ambient - Short clips of things happening in the office like phones ringing
* Events - These are longer clips either happening in a conference room or in the main office. Depending on the type of event they may have additional filters applied to make it sound more realistic.
